# Consciousness Debugging Commands & Story Integration

This document defines all user debugging actions available in Runtime.zyjeski.com and how they integrate with the "Fractured Time" narrative. Every debugging command serves dual purposes: **technical consciousness manipulation** and **story progression trigger**.

**Ground State Principle**: All debugging commands modify consciousness state only when executed by user action. No automatic processes or background simulation occurs.

## Core Debugging Philosophy

### Consciousness-as-Code Debugging
- **Mental processes** are executable programs that can be analyzed, optimized, or terminated
- **Memory regions** store emotional experiences that can be accessed, protected, or corrupted
- **System resources** represent attention, emotional energy, and processing capacity
- **Errors** are psychological conflicts that manifest as debuggable system failures

### Narrative Integration Through Technical Actions
- **Terminal commands** reveal character psychology through technical diagnostics
- **Process manipulation** directly affects character emotional state and story progression
- **Memory access** unlocks suppressed experiences and narrative fragments
- **System optimization** represents psychological healing and character growth

## Terminal Command Reference

### Session Management

#### `attach <character-id>`
**Purpose**: Connect debugging session to character consciousness

**Usage**:
```bash
attach alexander-kane
```

**Technical Effect**:
- Loads character consciousness template into working state
- Initializes debugging session with character's mental processes
- Enables all other debugging commands for that character

**Story Integration**:
- **Attachment successful**: Displays character's current psychological state
- **First attachment**: Shows Alexander's critical system status and initial story context
- **Narrative snippet**: Brief glimpse into Alexander's mental state at connection

**Output Examples**:
```
Connected to consciousness: Alexander Kane
Status: CRITICAL - Multiple system failures detected
Active Processes: 3 | Memory Usage: 67.8% | Errors: 5
Warning: Grief processing memory leak detected (847MB)
Type 'ps' to view running processes or 'monitor' for system overview
```

#### `detach`
**Purpose**: Disconnect from character consciousness (preserves session state)

**Technical Effect**: Maintains consciousness state but disables debugging commands
**Story Integration**: None - technical session management only

### Process Management Commands

#### `ps`
**Purpose**: List all running mental processes

**Usage**:
```bash
ps              # List all processes
ps -aux         # Detailed process information
ps grief        # Filter processes containing 'grief'
```

**Technical Effect**:
- Displays current mental processes with PID, status, resource usage
- Shows process priority, start time, and current state
- Color-coded status indicators (green=stable, yellow=warning, red=critical)

**Story Integration**:
- **Initial discovery**: First view of Alexander's fragmented mental state
- **Process analysis**: Understanding Alexander's psychological priorities
- **Progress tracking**: See how debugging actions affect mental process health

**Output Example**:
```
PID    COMMAND              STATUS    CPU    MEMORY   PRIORITY  STARTED
1001   grief_processing     running   89.3%  847MB    critical  Mar 15 08:30
1002   memory_search        running   45.7%  234MB    high      Mar 15 08:31  
1003   reality_check        running   12.1%  89MB     normal    Mar 15 09:15
1004   emily_connection     sleeping  0.0%   45MB     low       Mar 15 08:35
```

**Narrative Triggers**:
- First `ps` execution reveals Alexander's mental crisis scope
- Discovering `emily_connection` in sleeping state hints at relationship problems
- High resource usage by `grief_processing` shows psychological priority

#### `kill <pid>`
**Purpose**: Terminate a mental process (high-risk intervention)

**Usage**:
```bash
kill 1001                    # Terminate grief_processing
kill -9 1002                 # Force terminate memory_search
kill grief_processing        # Terminate by process name
```

**Technical Effect**:
- Immediately stops specified mental process
- Frees allocated memory and CPU resources
- May cause system instability or emotional side effects
- Cannot kill protected core processes (survival, breathing, etc.)

**Story Integration**:
- **Major narrative decision points** - each kill command represents significant psychological intervention
- **Confirmation prompts** display potential consequences with narrative context
- **Immediate consequences** shown through system changes and character reactions

**Confirmation Prompts with Narrative**:
```bash
kill 1001
WARNING: Terminating grief_processing may cause emotional numbness
This could prevent Alexander from processing Leo's loss healthily
Continue? [y/N] y

Terminating grief_processing (PID 1001)...
✓ Process terminated successfully
Memory freed: 847MB
Alexander takes a deep breath. The crushing weight lifts... but so does something else.
WARNING: Emotional processing capability reduced
```

**Narrative Consequences by Process**:
- **`grief_processing`**: Emotional numbness path → potential fracture ending
- **`memory_search`**: Acceptance path → stops seeking Leo in other timelines  
- **`reality_check`**: Delusion path → may lose grip on current timeline
- **`emily_connection`**: Isolation path → relationship destruction

#### `restart <pid|process_name>`
**Purpose**: Restart crashed or terminated mental process

**Usage**:
```bash
restart 1001                 # Restart by PID
restart emily_connection     # Restart by name
restart --safe grief_processing  # Restart with memory limits
```

**Technical Effect**:
- Reinitializes specified mental process
- Allocates fresh memory and resources
- May restart with modified parameters (optimized versions)

**Story Integration**:
- **Redemption opportunities** - restore processes after destructive debugging
- **Character growth** - restarted processes may run more efficiently
- **Relationship repair** - restarting social processes enables reconnection

**Example Output**:
```bash
restart emily_connection
Initializing emily_connection process...
✓ Process started successfully (PID 1007)
Memory allocated: 85MB (optimized from previous 145MB)
Alexander notices Emily's coffee cup on the counter. When did she leave for work?
```

#### `optimize <process_name>`
**Purpose**: Improve process efficiency and reduce resource consumption

**Usage**:
```bash
optimize grief_processing    # Reduce memory usage, improve efficiency
optimize --memory memory_search  # Focus on memory optimization
optimize --cpu reality_check     # Focus on CPU optimization
```

**Technical Effect**:
- Reduces memory and CPU usage while maintaining functionality
- May add processing limits or timeout mechanisms
- Improves overall system stability
- Cannot optimize if process is currently crashing

**Story Integration**:
- **Healthy healing path** - most constructive approach to psychological issues
- **Gradual improvement** - shows character learning to manage emotions
- **Balanced solutions** - maintains emotional processing while preventing overconsumption

**Example Output**:
```bash
optimize grief_processing
Analyzing grief_processing efficiency...
Implementing memory management protocols...
Installing timeout mechanisms for obsessive loops...
✓ Optimization complete
  Memory usage: 847MB → 180MB (79% reduction)
  CPU usage: 89.3% → 34.2% (62% reduction)
  Processing efficiency: +45%

Alexander feels the constant ache in his chest ease slightly. 
The memories of Leo remain vivid, but no longer consume every thought.
```

### System Information Commands

#### `monitor`
**Purpose**: Display comprehensive system health overview

**Usage**:
```bash
monitor                      # Full system status
monitor --brief             # Condensed overview  
monitor resources           # Focus on resource usage
```

**Technical Effect**:
- Shows CPU, memory, and attention resource usage
- Lists active processes and their health status
- Displays current system errors and warnings
- Reports emotional state and stability metrics

**Story Integration**:

## Narrative Progression System

### Story Trigger Categories

#### Critical Decision Points
**High-impact debugging actions that determine ending path**

1. **Grief Processing Resolution**:
   - `kill grief_processing` → Emotional numbness path → Fracture ending
   - `optimize grief_processing` → Healthy processing path → Complete debug ending
   - `restart grief_processing --limited` → Managed grief path → Continual flux ending

2. **Memory Search Resolution**:
   - `kill memory_search` → Acceptance path → Leo is gone, focus on present
   - `optimize memory_search --timeout` → Controlled searching → Periodic hope cycles
   - `analyze memory_search --infinite-loop` → Understanding obsession → Breakthrough or breakdown

3. **Relationship Handler Intervention**:
   - `restart emily_connection` → Reconnection attempt → Marriage repair or final confrontation
   - `optimize emily_connection` → Healthy communication restoration → Healing together
   - `kill emily_connection` → Complete isolation → Relationship destruction

### Error-Driven Narrative

#### Failed Debugging as Story Elements
**When user debugging attempts fail, they become consciousness errors with narrative context**

**Example: Failed Process Termination**
```bash
kill reality_check
ERROR: Cannot terminate protected process - reality_check
Additional context: Alexander's grip on current timeline is already tenuous
Attempting to disable reality checking could cause complete dissociation
This error has been logged to consciousness error system
Alexander pauses, a chill running down his spine. Some processes can't be killed.
```

**Example: Resource Exhaustion**
```bash
optimize grief_processing
ERROR: Insufficient emotional energy for optimization
Current emotional energy: 15.7% (below minimum 25% for major interventions)
Recommendation: Restore emotional energy through relationship connections
Alexander tries to focus, but the weight of exhaustion is overwhelming.
Even his attempt to heal feels like another failure.
```

**Example: Memory Access Denied**
```bash
mem leo --access
ERROR: Memory region protected by grief_lock mechanism
Access requires: grief_processing optimization AND emily_connection active
Current status: grief_processing critical, emily_connection sleeping
Alexander reaches for the memory, but the pain blocks his access completely.
The protective mechanisms of his mind refuse to let him relive that day.
```

### Ending Path Determination

#### Complete Debug Ending
**Criteria**: Systematic optimization of all critical processes, relationship restoration, healthy grief management
**Key Actions**: 
- `optimize grief_processing` (successful)
- `restart emily_connection` (successful) 
- `optimize memory_search --timeout` (controlled searching)
- `analyze timeline --acceptance` (reality acceptance)

**Narrative Arc**: Alexander learns to process grief healthily, reconnects with Emily, accepts Leo's loss while maintaining hope for the future

#### Complete Fracture Ending  
**Criteria**: Destructive debugging leading to system collapse, relationship destruction, reality disconnection
**Key Actions**:
- `kill grief_processing` (emotional numbness)
- `kill emily_connection` (isolation)
- `kill reality_check` (delusion)
- `emergency reset` (multiple system failures)

**Narrative Arc**: Alexander's consciousness fragments completely, Emily leaves, he becomes lost in alternate timeline delusions

#### Continual Flux Ending
**Criteria**: Mixed debugging approach maintaining unstable equilibrium between hope and despair
**Key Actions**:
- `optimize grief_processing --partial` (incomplete healing)
- `restart emily_connection --limited` (strained relationship)
- `memory_search --periodic` (cyclical hope/despair)
- `monitor --maintain-critical` (managed instability)

**Narrative Arc**: Alexander achieves neither healing nor complete breakdown, living in perpetual uncertainty between timelines

## Best Practices for Story-Driven Debugging

### User Experience Guidelines

#### Progressive Disclosure
- **Early commands** (`ps`, `monitor`) provide safe exploration
- **Intermediate commands** (`kill`, `optimize`) introduce meaningful choice
- **Advanced commands** (`debug`, `analyze`) enable deep narrative exploration
- **Emergency commands** provide safety nets and alternative paths

#### Consequence Communication
- **Clear warnings** before destructive actions with narrative context
- **Immediate feedback** showing both technical and emotional effects
- **Progress tracking** through system state and story milestone indicators
- **Recovery options** available for learning from failed debugging attempts

#### Technical Authenticity
- **Real debugging concepts** applied to psychological processes
- **Consistent metaphors** between technical operations and emotional states
- **Professional tool aesthetics** maintaining IDE-like appearance
- **Meaningful resource management** reflecting actual mental capacity limits

### Development Implementation Notes

#### Command Processing Flow
1. **User Input**: Terminal command entered
2. **Validation**: Check syntax, permissions, and current state
3. **Confirmation**: Show warnings and consequences for risky actions
4. **Execution**: Apply technical changes to consciousness state
5. **Effects**: Update all interfaces (monitor, debugger) with new state
6. **Narrative**: Check for story progression triggers and display relevant fragments
7. **Persistence**: Save consciousness state changes for session continuity

#### State Management Integration
- **Command execution** triggers `App.applyStateChange()` with detailed change log
- **Monitor updates** reflect consciousness modifications immediately
- **Debugger sync** regenerates code view and variable inspection
- **Story progression** tracked through cumulative debugging choice analysis
- **Error generation** creates new consciousness errors for failed debugging attempts

#### Story Fragment Integration
- **Context-sensitive display** in terminal output, error messages, and system responses
- **Character voice consistency** maintaining Alexander's perspective throughout
- **Technical integration** embedding narrative in system messages and error outputs
- **Progressive revelation** unlocking story elements through debugging competency

The debugging command system serves as the primary interface for both **technical consciousness manipulation** and **narrative progression** in "Fractured Time," ensuring that every user action contributes meaningfully to both the debugging experience and Alexander Kane's psychological journey.
